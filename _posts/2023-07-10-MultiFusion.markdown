We worked on developing a refined model (YOLO and R-CNN Family) for detecting multiple objects by fusing thermal and visible images. The fusion techniques, including Multiscale Fusion, Channel-Based Fusion, and Blind Source Separation, significantly improve target detection in hazardous environments, enhancing safety and security in critical applications like autonomous driving and surveillance.
