LLaVA-PlantDiag, is a conversational AI system designed for plant pathology.
We use visual instruction tuning to answer open-ended questions about plant diseases.
Our model outperforms others like GPT-4 Vision and Gemini,
scoring 64.7 in multi-turn question-answering and achieving 96% accuracy in classification.
We also release first multimodal data on plant-pathology.
