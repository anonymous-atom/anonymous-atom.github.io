Working on multimodal LLMs and any-to-any generation models. Implemented multi-stage training for interleaved generation in MLLMs. Added SDXL support for DDPO into trl library for custom diffusion model training. Pre-trained Any-to-Any model on CC3M, WebVid and AudioCap for encoder side alignment (on 8TB Data). Working on dataset and reward modeling to improve scientific question generation on long sequences.
